        **python for converting building simulation archetypes**
        
        Convert IDF file (EnergyPlus) to BUI file (TRNBuild)
        
        ## Overview
        
        ** Translater** is a Python package that helps converting building archetypes. The public feature released in this
        version is the  conversion of [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) IDF models to Trnsys [TrnBuild](http://www.trnsys.com/features/suite-of-tools.php.html) Models (compatible with the multizone building model). For a list of features
        currently in development see the [In development](#in-development) section.
